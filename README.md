# my-own-select

`my-own-select` is a highly customizable dropdown select component built using the `customElements` API. It is compatible with both ReactJS and Angular, and it allows for in-depth customization of the dropdown appearance and behavior. `my-own-select` offers a flexible structure, allowing you to insert HTML tags, components, and styled elements as options within the select dropdown.

## Installation

You can install `my-own-select` via npm:

```bash
npm install my-own-select
```

## Usage

To use `my-own-select` in your project, simply include it as a custom HTML element. Below is an example of how to use it:

### HTML

```html
<my-own-select>
   <p>First option</p>
   <h1>Second option</h1>
   <Component></Component>
</my-own-select>
```

### ReactJS

For ReactJS, ensure you import and use the `my-own-select` component as a custom element within your JSX code. You may need to register the component to ensure it works as expected:

```javascript
import 'my-own-select';

function App() {
  const selectRef = React.useRef();

  React.useEffect(() => {
    const handleSelection = (event) => {
      console.log("Selected option:", event.detail);
    };
    const currentSelect = selectRef.current;
    currentSelect.addEventListener("selection", handleSelection);

    return () => currentSelect.removeEventListener("selection", handleSelection);
  }, []);

  return (
    <my-own-select ref={selectRef}>
      <p>First option</p>
      <h1>Second option</h1>
      <MyComponent />
    </my-own-select>
  );
}
```

### Angular

For Angular projects, you may need to allow custom elements within your module by configuring `CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA`:

```typescript
import { NgModule, CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA } from '@angular/core';
import 'my-own-select';

@NgModule({
  schemas: [CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

Then, you can use `my-own-select` in your Angular templates and listen for the `selection` event:

```html
<my-own-select (selection)="onSelection($event)">
   <p>First option</p>
   <h1>Second option</h1>
   <my-component></my-component>
</my-own-select>
```

In your Angular component, define the `onSelection` method:

```typescript
export class AppComponent {
  onSelection(event: CustomEvent) {
    console.log("Selected option:", event.detail);
  }
}
```

## CSS Customization

`my-own-select` provides parts that can be styled via the `::part()` selector. This allows you to fully customize the dropdownâ€™s appearance:

- **Select container**: Customize the main select element.
  ```css
  my-own-select::part(select) {
    /* Add your styles here */
    background-color: lightgray;
    border: 1px solid #ccc;
    padding: 10px;
  }
  ```

- **Options container**: Style the container holding all options.
  ```css
  my-own-select::part(itemsContainer) {
    /* Add your styles here */
    background-color: white;
    border: 1px solid #ccc;
    max-height: 200px;
    overflow-y: auto;
  }
  ```

- **Single option item**: Customize individual options.
  ```css
  my-own-select::part(item) {
    /* Add your styles here */
    padding: 8px;
    cursor: pointer;
  }
  my-own-select::part(item-selected) {
    /* Selected item */
    background-color: #f0f0f0;
  }
  ```

## Custom Event: `selection`

When an option is selected, `my-own-select` emits a custom event called `selection`. This can be intercepted in both ReactJS and Angular:

- **ReactJS**: Use a `ref` to attach an event listener to `my-own-select` and handle the selection event.
- **Angular**: Bind directly to the `(selection)` event on the `my-own-select` tag.

## Compatibility

`my-own-select` is built with the `customElements` API, making it natively compatible across modern browsers. It integrates seamlessly with popular frontend frameworks like ReactJS and Angular.
